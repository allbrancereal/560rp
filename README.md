## License

This project uses a **dual licensing** model. This means the software is available under two different licenses:

1. **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: Open Source GPL - This allows anyone, including consumers, to use, modify, and distribute the software. They can even make money from it, for example, by offering consulting or support services.

2. **Commercial License**: Private - This is required for commercial use of the software, especially if the company wants to use the software without the obligations of the GPL (like sharing any modifications you profit off).

### GNU General Public License (GPL)
